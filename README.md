You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Design

### Key features
- Score board, changed every day
- A counter for number of attempts at guessing the number
- A high and low indicator for each guess that will indicate if your guess is too high or low
- A practice option with another number generator that will help you practice
- Log out button
- Hint for the number of digits the daily number is: might change
- Also features a time and date so you can tell when each person completed the challenge, might facilitate competition for how fast someone can guess the number and the lowest amount of attempts

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML**: structures application. 3 HTML pages, login, home, and practice
- **CSS**: apply styling and color so that the website is not bland
- **React**: provides login, and routing components
- **Service**: back-end endpoints,
  1. login
  2. check if guess matches random number
  3. submit a score once number is guessed
  4. retrieving Date and time at time.google.com
- **DB Login**: stores the login credentials and keeps updated which users have already completed the daily number.
- **WebSocket**: as each player guesses the daily number, the score board will be updated for all users
